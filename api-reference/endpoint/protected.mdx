A test endpoint that requires authentication to access. This endpoint can be used to verify that your authentication credentials are working correctly and to retrieve your organization ID.

## Authentication

This endpoint supports two authentication methods:

### API Key Authentication

Include a valid API key in the `x-api-key` header of the request:

```json
"x-api-key": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
```

### OAuth Authentication

Include the following headers in your request:

```json
"x-auth-token": "oauth-token"
"x-public-key": "your-public-key"
"x-secret-key": "your-secret-key"
```

## Response Example

```json
{
  "message": "Successfully authenticated",
  "organizationId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
}
```

## Error Response

If authentication fails, you will receive a 401 Unauthorized response:

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid or missing authentication credentials"
}
```

## Using Your Organization ID

The `organizationId` returned by this endpoint is your unique identifier in the Pure system. This ID may be required for certain operations or when contacting support about your account.
