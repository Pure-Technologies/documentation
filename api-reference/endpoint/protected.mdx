A test endpoint that requires a valid API key to access. This endpoint can be used to verify that your API key is working correctly and to retrieve your organization ID.

## Authentication

This endpoint requires a valid API key to be included in the `x-api-key` header of the request.

## Response Example

```json
{
  "message": "Successfully authenticated",
  "organizationId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
}
```

## Error Response

If authentication fails, you will receive a 401 Unauthorized response:

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid or missing API key"
}
```

## Using Your Organization ID

The `organizationId` returned by this endpoint is your unique identifier in the Pure system. This ID may be required for certain operations or when contacting support about your account.
