## Understanding Spot Prices

Spot prices represent the current market price at which a precious metal can be bought or sold for immediate delivery. The API provides both bid and ask prices:

- **Bid Price**: The price at which buyers are willing to purchase the metal
- **Ask Price**: The price at which sellers are willing to sell the metal

The difference between the ask and bid prices is known as the spread, which represents the dealer's profit margin.

## Market Status

The `marketOpen` field indicates whether the market for that particular metal is currently open for trading. Markets typically operate Sunday through Friday but may close for holidays or other special circumstances.

## Price Changes

The API provides two metrics for tracking price changes:

- **changePercent**: Percentage change in price from the previous day's close
- **changePrice**: Absolute price change from the previous day's close (in USD)
