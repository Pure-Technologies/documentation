Exchange an OAuth authorization code for an access token. This endpoint allows you to obtain an authentication token that can be used for subsequent API requests.

## Request Body

<ParamField body="code" type="string" required>
  The authorization code received from the OAuth provider
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="public_key" type="string" required>
  The public key for the OAuth application
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="secret_key" type="string" required>
  The secret key for the OAuth application
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="redirect_url" type="string" required>
  The redirect URL used in the initial authorization request
</ParamField>

## Response Example

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6InB1cmUtand0LWtleSJ9...",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "id_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6InB1cmUtand0LWtleSJ9...",
  "refresh_token": "rt_abc123def456ghi789"
}
```

## Using the Token

After obtaining the token, include it in subsequent API requests using the following headers:

```json
"x-auth-token": "your-access-token"
"x-public-key": "your-public-key"
"x-secret-key": "your-secret-key"
```

The `id_token` is included in the response when the `openid` scope is granted, and the `refresh_token` is included when the `offline_access` scope is granted.

## Error Responses

If the request is invalid or authentication fails, the API will return an error response:

```json
{
  "error": "invalid_request",
  "error_description": "The authorization code is invalid or has expired"
}
```

Common error codes include:

- `invalid_request`: The request is missing a required parameter or is otherwise malformed
- `invalid_client`: Client authentication failed
- `invalid_grant`: The authorization code is invalid or has expired
- `unauthorized_client`: The client is not authorized to use this grant type
- `server_error`: An unexpected error occurred on the server
