## Welcome to the Pure Public API

The Pure Public API provides access to marketplace data including products, spot prices, orders, and more. This API allows you to integrate Pure's marketplace data into your applications.

## Authentication

The Pure API supports two authentication methods:

### API Key Authentication

Most endpoints can be authenticated using API keys. You need to include your API key in the `x-api-key` header with each request.

```json
"x-api-key": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
```

### OAuth Authentication

For more secure integrations, you can use OAuth authentication. This requires three headers:

```json
"x-auth-token": "oauth-token"
"x-public-key": "your-public-key"
"x-secret-key": "your-secret-key"
```

To obtain an OAuth token, use the `/v1/oauth/token` endpoint. See the [OAuth Token](#) documentation for details.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to the following base URL:

```
https://public.api.collectpure.com/
```

We are currently on version 1 of the API, and requests must include the version in the path. For example:

```
https://public.api.collectpure.com/v1/products
```

## Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format. Successful responses will contain the requested data, while error responses will include an `error` field with a description of what went wrong.

## Available Endpoints

The Pure Public API provides the following categories of endpoints:

- **Products**: Access detailed information about products, including their attributes, manufacturers, categories, and market data.
- **Marketplace**: Get real-time spot prices for precious metals.
- **Purchase Orders**: Retrieve information about purchase orders.
- **Sale Orders**: Retrieve information about sale orders.
- **Authentication**: Authentication-related endpoints, including OAuth token generation.
