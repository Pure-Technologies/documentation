## Welcome to the Pure Public API

The Pure Public API provides access to marketplace data including products, spot prices, and more. This API allows you to integrate Pure's marketplace data into your applications.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using API keys. You need to include your API key in the `x-api-key` header with each request.

```json
"x-api-key": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
```

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to the following base URL:

```
https://public.api.collectpure.com/
```

## Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format. Successful responses will contain the requested data, while error responses will include an `error` field with a description of what went wrong.

## Rate Limits

Please contact us at [support@collectpure.com](mailto:support@collectpure.com) for information about rate limits for your API key.
